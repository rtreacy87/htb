# Getting Started with the HTB Parser Project

## Welcome! 👋

This guide will help you understand and build a parser that converts Hack The Box (HTB) writeup PDFs into clean, readable markdown files. Don't worry if you're new to coding - we'll walk through everything step by step!

## What Are We Building?

Imagine you have a PDF file containing a cybersecurity writeup from Hack The Box. These PDFs often contain:
- Commands you need to type in a terminal
- Code snippets in various programming languages
- Step-by-step instructions
- Screenshots and diagrams
- Technical explanations

Our parser will automatically read these PDFs and convert them into markdown files that are:
- Easy to read and search
- Properly formatted with code blocks
- Structured with clear headings
- Ready for use with AI tools

## Why Is This Useful?

**Before our parser:**
```
😞 PDF files are hard to search through
😞 Can't easily copy commands from PDFs
😞 Difficult to share specific sections
😞 Not great for AI tools to understand
```

**After our parser:**
```
😊 Clean, searchable markdown files
😊 Easy copy-paste of commands
😊 Well-organized content structure
😊 Perfect for AI analysis and learning
```

## Project Overview

Our parser works like a smart translator:

1. **Input**: HTB writeup PDF file
2. **Processing**: Extract text, identify different content types, organize structure
3. **Output**: Clean markdown file

Think of it like having a very smart assistant that reads through a PDF and creates a perfectly organized summary for you!

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this project, you'll understand:

- How to extract text from PDF files using Python
- How to recognize different types of content (commands, code, explanations)
- How to convert content into markdown format
- How to handle images and complex layouts
- How to test and validate your code

## Prerequisites

**Don't worry if you don't have all of these yet - we'll help you set everything up!**

### Basic Knowledge Needed:
- Basic understanding of what a file and folder are
- Willingness to learn and experiment
- Patience (coding takes practice!)

### What We'll Install Together:
- Python programming language
- A code editor (like VS Code)
- Some helpful Python libraries
- A few command-line tools

## Project Structure

Here's how our project will be organized:

```
htb_parser/
├── wikis/                  # These helpful guides!
├── src/                    # Our main code files
│   ├── pdf_processor.py    # Handles PDF reading
│   ├── content_analyzer.py # Identifies content types
│   ├── markdown_generator.py # Creates markdown output
│   └── main.py            # Brings everything together
├── tests/                  # Code to test our parser
├── examples/              # Sample PDFs and outputs
└── requirements.txt       # List of needed libraries
```

## How to Use These Wikis

Each wiki builds on the previous ones:

1. **Start with this guide** - Get oriented and excited!
2. **Follow the setup guide** - Get your computer ready
3. **Work through each phase** - Build the parser step by step
4. **Test as you go** - Make sure everything works
5. **Celebrate your success!** 🎉

### Reading Tips:

- 📝 **Code blocks** will show you exactly what to type
- 💡 **Tip boxes** will give you helpful hints
- ⚠️ **Warning boxes** will help you avoid common mistakes
- 🔍 **Deep dive sections** will explain the "why" behind the code

## What's Next?

Ready to start? Here's your roadmap:

1. **Next**: Read "02-understanding-the-architecture.md" to learn how our parser works
2. **Then**: Follow "03-development-environment-setup.md" to get your computer ready
3. **After that**: Start building with "04-phase1-basic-pdf-extraction.md"

## Getting Help

Stuck on something? Here are some tips:

- **Read the error messages** - They often tell you exactly what's wrong
- **Check the troubleshooting guide** - Common problems and solutions
- **Take breaks** - Sometimes stepping away helps you see the solution
- **Experiment** - Try small changes to see what happens

## Encouragement

Remember: Every expert was once a beginner! 

- It's okay to not understand everything immediately
- Making mistakes is part of learning
- Each small step gets you closer to the goal
- You're building something really useful!
