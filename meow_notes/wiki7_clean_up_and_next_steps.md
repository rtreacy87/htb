# Clean-up and Next Steps

## Objective
Properly terminate the lab session and plan continued learning

## Lab Termination Process

### Step 1: System Clean-up

After completing the lab and capturing the flag, it's important to properly exit the system and clean up your session:

```bash
exit            # Logout from Telnet session
```

This will close your Telnet connection to the target machine and return you to your local terminal.

If you were performing this in a real-world authorized penetration test, you might also need to:
- Remove any tools or files you uploaded
- Restore any configurations you modified
- Document all changes made to the system
- Ensure no backdoors or persistent access remains

However, in the HTB lab environment, these steps are not necessary as the machine will be reset when you stop it.

### Step 2: Stopping the Machine

Once you've completed the lab and exited the Telnet session, you should stop the target machine to free up resources:

1. Navigate to the Meow machine page on the HTB website
2. Click the "Stop Machine" button
3. Confirm that you want to stop the machine
4. Wait for the status to change to "Stopped"

This will release the machine resources and stop your lab timer.

### Step 3: Disconnecting VPN

If you're using the OpenVPN connection method, you should properly disconnect from the VPN:

1. Go to the terminal window where the OpenVPN client is running
2. Press `Ctrl+C` to terminate the connection
3. Verify the connection is closed by checking your network interfaces:
   ```bash
   ip a
   ```
   The `tun0` interface should no longer be present

If you're using the Pwnbox, simply closing the browser tab will terminate your session.

### Step 4: Documentation Finalization

Before concluding the lab, make sure your documentation is complete:

- Organize your notes
- Save any important command outputs
- Ensure you have recorded the flag
- Document the vulnerability and exploitation method
- Note any challenges or learning points

Good documentation is essential for learning and for professional penetration testing.
