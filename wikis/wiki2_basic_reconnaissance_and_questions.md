# Basic Reconnaissance and Question Answers

## Objective
Answer initial knowledge-based questions and understand fundamental concepts

## Key Questions to Address

### Question 1: VM Terminology
- **Question**: What does the acronym VM stand for?
- **Answer**: Virtual Machine
- **Concept**: Understanding virtualization technology

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer system. It allows you to run an operating system and applications in an isolated environment, separate from your host machine. In the context of penetration testing, VMs are essential as they provide a safe, controlled environment for testing security vulnerabilities without affecting your main system.

### Question 2: Command Line Interface
- **Question**: What tool do we use to interact with the operating system via command line?
- **Answer**: Terminal (also known as console or shell)
- **Concept**: Command-line interface fundamentals

The terminal (also called console or shell) is a text-based interface used to interact with your operating system through commands. Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), terminals allow for precise control and automation through text commands. In cybersecurity, the terminal is an essential tool as many security tools and techniques require command-line operations.

### Question 3: VPN Service
- **Question**: What service do we use to form our VPN connection into HTB labs?
- **Answer**: OpenVPN
- **Concept**: Virtual Private Network protocols

OpenVPN is an open-source VPN protocol that creates secure point-to-point connections. Hack The Box uses OpenVPN to establish a secure connection between your machine and their lab environment. This connection ensures that all traffic between your system and the lab network is encrypted and isolated from the public internet, creating a safe environment for ethical hacking practice.

### Question 4: Tunnel Interface
- **Question**: What is the abbreviated name for a 'tunnel interface' in the VPN output?
- **Answer**: tun
- **Concept**: Network tunneling and interface naming

When you connect to a VPN using OpenVPN, it creates a virtual network interface called a "tunnel interface" or "tun" for short. This interface handles the encrypted traffic between your machine and the VPN server. In the OpenVPN connection output, you'll see references to "tun0" or similar, indicating that the tunnel interface has been successfully created.

## Skills Learned
- Basic cybersecurity terminology
- Network interface concepts
- VPN technology understanding
- Command-line tool identification

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Exploring Virtual Machines
1. Research different types of virtualization (Type 1 vs Type 2 hypervisors)
2. Compare popular VM software (VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V)
3. Identify the benefits of using VMs in cybersecurity testing

### Exercise 2: Terminal Commands Exploration
1. Open a terminal on your system
2. Try the following basic commands:
   ```bash
   pwd         # Print working directory
   ls -la      # List all files with details
   whoami      # Display current username
   ifconfig    # Show network interfaces (or 'ip a' on newer systems)
   ```
3. Research and try 5 additional terminal commands

### Exercise 3: VPN Protocols Comparison
1. Research at least three different VPN protocols (OpenVPN, WireGuard, IPSec)
2. Create a comparison table of their features, security, and performance
3. Explain why OpenVPN is commonly used in penetration testing environments

### Exercise 4: Network Interfaces
1. On your system, run the appropriate command to list network interfaces:
   - Linux/Mac: `ifconfig` or `ip a`
   - Windows: `ipconfig /all`
2. Identify your physical network interfaces
3. If you connect to a VPN, observe the creation of the tun/tap interface
4. Document the differences between physical and virtual network interfaces
