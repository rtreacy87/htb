# Post-Exploitation and Flag Capture

## Objective
Navigate the compromised system and locate the target flag

## System Exploration

### Step 1: Initial Reconnaissance

After successfully gaining access to the system via Telnet, our first step is to gather basic information about the environment we're in. This helps us understand the system and locate potential points of interest.

Let's start with some basic commands:

```bash
whoami          # Confirm user privileges
```

Expected output:
```
root
```

This confirms we are operating with root (administrative) privileges, which gives us full access to the system.

Next, let's check our current location in the file system:

```bash
pwd             # Check current directory
```

Expected output:
```
/root
```

This shows we are in the root user's home directory, which is typically where important files might be stored.

Now, let's list the contents of this directory:

```bash
ls -la          # List directory contents with details
```

Expected output:
```
total 28
drwx------  4 root root 4096 May 21 12:34 .
drwxr-xr-x 18 root root 4096 May 21 12:34 ..
-rw-------  1 root root    0 May 21 12:34 .bash_history
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 3106 Dec  5  2019 .bashrc
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 May 21 12:34 .local
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  161 Dec  5  2019 .profile
drwx------  2 root root 4096 May 21 12:34 .ssh
-rw-r--r--  1 root root   33 May 21 12:34 flag.txt
```

In the output, we can see several files and directories, including:
- `.bash_history`: Command history file (empty in this case)
- `.bashrc` and `.profile`: Shell configuration files
- `.local` and `.ssh`: Directories for local configurations and SSH keys
- `flag.txt`: This appears to be our target file!

### Step 2: Directory Navigation

We've already found what appears to be the flag file in our current directory. In more complex scenarios, you might need to navigate through the file system to find the flag or other sensitive information.

Some useful navigation commands include:

```bash
cd /            # Change to root directory
cd /home        # Change to home directory
cd ..           # Move up one directory
find / -name flag.txt -type f 2>/dev/null  # Search for files named flag.txt
```

However, in this case, we've already found the flag file in the root user's home directory, so we don't need to navigate further.

### Step 3: Flag Capture

Now that we've located the flag file, let's view its contents:

```bash
cat flag.txt
```

Expected output:
```
b40abdfe23665f766f9c61ecba8a4c19
```

This is the flag we're looking for! The flag is typically a hash value (MD5, SHA1, etc.) or a specific string format. In this case, it appears to be a 32-character MD5 hash.

Make sure to copy this value exactly as shown, as it will be needed for submission.

### Step 4: Flag Submission

Now that we have captured the flag, we need to submit it to complete the challenge:

1. Navigate to the HTB Starting Point page in your browser
2. Find the Meow machine card
3. Click on the "Submit Flag" button
4. Paste the captured flag value into the submission field
5. Click "Submit"
6. If correct, you'll receive a confirmation and points will be awarded to your account

## Post-Exploitation Concepts

### Privilege Escalation

In this lab, we gained root access directly through the Telnet login, so we didn't need to perform privilege escalation. However, in real-world scenarios, initial access often provides limited privileges, requiring additional techniques to gain higher access levels.

**Types of Privilege Escalation**:
- **Vertical Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher permission levels (e.g., user to admin)
- **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**: Accessing resources of another user at the same permission level

**Common Privilege Escalation Vectors**:
- Exploiting misconfigured sudo permissions
- Leveraging vulnerable services running as root
- Exploiting kernel vulnerabilities
- Using password reuse or weak credentials
- Taking advantage of cron jobs running as privileged users
- Exploiting SUID/SGID binaries

### Data Exfiltration

In penetration testing, after gaining access to a system, identifying and extracting sensitive information is often a key objective. This process is known as data exfiltration.

**File System Exploration Techniques**:
- Searching for files with specific extensions (e.g., .conf, .key, .pem)
- Looking in common locations for sensitive files
- Examining user home directories
- Checking configuration directories

**Sensitive Data Identification**:
- Credentials and password files
- Configuration files
- Database files
- Backup files
- Private keys and certificates
- Personal identifiable information (PII)
- Intellectual property

**Information Gathering Commands**:
```bash
find / -name "*.conf" -type f 2>/dev/null  # Find configuration files
find / -name "*.key" -type f 2>/dev/null   # Find key files
find / -name "*.db" -type f 2>/dev/null    # Find database files
find /home -type f -name "*.txt" 2>/dev/null  # Find text files in home directories
grep -r "password" /etc/ 2>/dev/null       # Search for password strings in config files
```

## Best Practices

### Documentation

Proper documentation is essential in penetration testing for several reasons:
- Provides evidence of findings
- Helps in reproducing issues
- Assists in creating comprehensive reports
- Supports the remediation process

**What to Document**:
- Commands executed and their outputs
- Vulnerabilities discovered
- Exploitation methods used
- System information gathered
- Screenshots of critical findings
- Timestamps of activities

### Maintaining Detailed Logs

Keeping detailed logs helps track your activities and findings:
- Use script or tee commands to log terminal sessions
- Take notes of each step performed
- Record unexpected behaviors or errors
- Document successful and unsuccessful attempts
- Note system responses to various commands

### Screenshot Important Steps

Visual evidence is valuable for documentation:
- Capture successful exploitation
- Screenshot privilege escalation confirmation
- Document sensitive data discovered
- Show flag capture
- Record system information displays

### Verify Flag Accuracy

Before submission, ensure the flag is accurate:
- Double-check the flag format
- Verify all characters are correctly copied
- Ensure no extra spaces or characters are included
- Confirm the flag matches the expected format for the challenge

## Conclusion

In this phase, we successfully explored the compromised system, located the flag file, and captured its contents. We learned about post-exploitation techniques, the importance of proper documentation, and best practices for penetration testing.

The next wiki will cover the lessons learned from this exercise and broader security concepts that can be applied to real-world scenarios.
